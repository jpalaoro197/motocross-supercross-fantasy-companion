 this project will need an api, user authentication, and a database. I'm going to make an effort to make this project in react redux, unsure how succseful i'll be in react so i may fall back on C#.

Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?) This project is going to be a new form of fantasy motocross racing. users should be able to enjoy competing with eachother, and be able to keep track of total point scores for single races, and total season sports

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
The mvp for the fantasy app will be at the very least an application that is capable of tracking a riders position in a race and tracking assigned riders points for finish position.

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
nodejs
react
axios
html
javascript


If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
ultimately the goal is to build out a full fantasy/companion application, id like to have full authoriation, ability to see other users scores, previous race results.

further exploration technology 
firestore
css

large task to take on, but i wouldn't mind making this an actual production application for an opportunity to be both in the tech and moto industry
