### What is a Scraping API?
#### A scraping API is a data extraction tool designed for specific websites, databases, or programs. Its goal is to provide valuable and structured data to people and eliminate the need for individual research and data scraping. A great example of a scraping API is Ahrefs: a website that provides SEO data on websites and keywords. Ahrefs has a sophisticated algorithm and data scraping model that provides information on keyword difficulty, volume, organic and paid traffic to websites, etc. Since Ahrefs has a ton of data, a scraping API makes the process of extracting the data very quick and easy. For example, users can enter a keyword into the search bar and get all SEO-related information about it that Ahrefs has collected. -may cost money thooo.
