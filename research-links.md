### What is a Scraping API?
#### A scraping API is a data extraction tool designed for specific websites, databases, or programs. Its goal is to provide valuable and structured data to people and eliminate the need for individual research and data scraping. A great example of a scraping API is Ahrefs: a website that provides SEO data on websites and keywords. Ahrefs has a sophisticated algorithm and data scraping model that provides information on keyword difficulty, volume, organic and paid traffic to websites, etc. Since Ahrefs has a ton of data, a scraping API makes the process of extracting the data very quick and easy. For example, users can enter a keyword into the search bar and get all SEO-related information about it that Ahrefs has collected. -may cost money thooo.

### What is web scraping
#### Web scraping refers to the process of collecting large amounts of data from across the internet. For example, websites that sell plane tickets from many different providers scrape the data from various websites once a request is made. This allows businesses and customers to compare market prices and make more informed decisions.The problem with web scraping is that IP addresses often get blocked from performing an extensive number of searches because they get flagged as spammy. This is where proxy servers can come in. Proxy servers provide alternative IP addresses that help overcome such blocks and allow for the collection of as much data as needed
